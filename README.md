#  |  "SLOT"  |  SUPER-LAZY-OSINT-TOOLS  |  "SLOT"  |
#         ...An "OSINT" tool in the making...
# Requirements:
# LazyScript. Kalitorify. Mate-terminal. Gnome-terminal. Xterm. Qterminal. zsh. Htop. 
# ^^ apt-get install  OR  git clone from github.com ^^
# DESCRIPTION:
# OneDollarLiner SuperLazyLaunch with Kalitorify - good & lazy fresh outta the matrix "script" with cherry on top! Made by hashtag17th & scriptkewltweak.
## LazyScript should start automatically. If not: Hit small L key (l OR /.l) when the script is done loading Kalitorify and the root window is highlighted
##  - this opens the Lazy script(if installed) in your new root terminal window while kalitorify and cmatrix is running in the background.
# Q=ExitsTheCmatrix and you can now hit enter or ctrl+c to shut it down. Or you can un-comment or delete the read command on line 4 in the slot.sh file.
# Dropdown terminal (xterm) with Kalitorify will close after launching Tor IP service - Htop dropdown terminal can be shown or hidden with the F12 key.
# TIPS:
## Adjust your terminal window opacity so that you can see the data in the background.
## The intension with this script is to have the root window highlighted with a "kewl" background. And later build more tools into it; f.ex.with PhoneInfoga, Nmap and              ## SparrowWifi+positions=window-placement UI and .exe etc. With "undercover" features.
# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS MINOR "TWEAK" OF SOFTWARE. 
# THIS IS OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE SECURITY OSINT TOOL(S). A WORK IN PROGRESS IN A WORLD OF REGRESS.
# PS:
# The final echo line needs an apt update command after it if you want to update your OS before launching tools.
# Example: sudo apt update -y | sudo parrot-upgrade -y | OR: sudo apt-get update/upgrade(don't use "apt-get" on Parrot OS[!!!])
