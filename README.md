# SuperLazyOsintTool
# An "OSINT" tool in the making. 

# Inspiration from and thanks to sundevdown, brainfucksec and arismelachroinos!

# Requirements:
# LazyScript. Kalitorify. Mate-terminal. Gnome-terminal. Qterminal. zsh. Htop. 
# ^^ apt-get install  OR  git clone from github.com ^^

#DESCRIPTION:
## OneDollarLiner SuperLazyLaunch with Kalitorify - good & lazy fresh outta the matrix "script" with cherry on top! Made by hashtag17th & scriptkewltweak.
## Hit small L key (l OR /.l) when the script is done loading Kalitorify and the root window is highlighted - this opens the Lazy script(if installed) in your new root terminal
# window while kalitorify and cmatrix is running in the background. This will be 
# Q=ExitsTheCmatrix and you can now hit enter or ctrl+c to shut it down. Or you can un-comment or delete the read command on line 4.

# TIPS:
## Adjust your terminal window opacity so that you can see the data in the background.
## If Kalitorify is running for the first time it will take priority and will be highlighted OVER the root terminal window.
## If Kalitorify is not running for the first time,and it's just renewing your IP, it will be placed behind the root terminal window - with opacity on your terminal window you can ## verify when IP is given, Kalitorify will autoclose when done.
## The intension with this script is to have the root window highlighted with a "kewl" background. And later build more tools into it; f.ex.with PhoneInfoga, Nmap and              ## SparrowWifi+positions=window-placement etc.

# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS MINOR "TWEAK" OF SOFTWARE. 
# THIS IS OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE SECURITY OSINT TOOL(S). A WORK IN PROGRESS IN A WORLD OF REGRESS.

# The final echo line needs an apt update command after it if you want to update your OS before launching tools.
# Example: sudo apt update -y | sudo parrot-upgrade -y | OR: sudo apt-get update/upgrade(don't use "apt-get" on Parrot OS[!!!])
